</div>

## News
-[2025/04/01] ðŸ”¥We released new checkpoints of LLaVA-UHD v2 based on [Qwen2.0-7B-instruct](https://huggingface.co/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2-Qwen2.0-7B) and [Vicuna-13B](https://huggingface.co/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2-Vicuna-13B).

-[2024/12/19] ðŸ”¥LLaVA-UHD v2 achieves superior
performance over existing MLLMs on 15 popular benchmarks. 
Notably, our design
brings an average boost of 3.7% across 14 benchmarks compared with the baseline
method(LLaVA-UHD), 9.3% on DocVQA for instance.
 [Model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2) and [LLaVA-UHD-v2-SFT-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2-SFT-Data) are available in huggingface.

-[2024/07/29] LLaVA-UHD achieves performance improvement on 8 common benchmarks beyong LLaVA-1.5. 
Our novel projector, **spatially constrained resampler**, realizes high feature compression and convergence efficiency. 
Model checkpoints are available in [hugging-face](https://huggingface.co/guozonghao96/llava-uhd-144-13b).
You can find the original project instruction and code of **LLaVA-UHD** in branch `LLaVA-UHD-v1`

-[2024/07/01] ðŸ“¢[LLaVA-UHD](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/11080.pdf) is accepted by ECCV2024.

## Overview
**LLaVA-UHD v2**, an MLLM with advanced perception abilities by introducing a well-designed vision-language projector, the Hierarchical window (Hiwin) transformer. Hiwin transformer enhances MLLM's ability to capture diverse multi-modal visual granularities, by incorporating 
our constructed high-resolution semantic pyramid. 
Notably, our model built on **LLaVA-UHD**, brings an average boost of 3.7% across 14 benchmarks compared with the baseline
method, 9.3% on DocVQA for instance.

![The LLaVA-UHD framework](doc/arch.png)

LLaVA-UHD v2 includes two key components: 

(i) **Visual detail injection module**, which progressively injects low-level visual details into high-level language-aligned semantics features, thereby forming an inverse semantic pyramid (ISP),
and
![pyramid](doc/pyramid.png)

(ii) **hierarchical window attention**, which leverages cross-scale windows to condense multi-level semantics from the ISP. ![The Hierarchical Window Attention](doc/HiWin.png)

## Environment Preparing
1. To reproduce the results of the paper, please set up the Python environment using the following code:
```bash
conda create -n llava-uhd python=3.10
conda activate llava-uhd
sh install.sh
```

2. Download the checkpoints of [CLIP-ViT-L/14-336](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336) and [Vicuna-7B-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5). And put them into ```./pretrained_models```. In the checkpoint path of vicuna-7b-v1.5, set 'do_sample' in 'generation_config.json' as 'True', otherwise there is an error when saving training checkpoint.

If something wrong happens, please kindly refer to the issues of [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/issues) 
or submit issues in our repository.

## Data Preparing
1. **Visual detail injection module pre-training Data**:
Download [MS-COCO stuff 2017](https://github.com/nightrome/cocostuff).
2. **Pretraining Data**: Download the 558K subset of the LAION-CC-SBU dataset with BLIP captions we use in the paper [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain).
And put the data into ```./playground/data```. 
3. **Fine-tuning Data**: Please download all images and the instruction-tuning annotations ```llava-uhd-v2-sft-data.json``` in [LLaVA-UHD-v2-SFT-Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2-SFT-Data). And place them in the ```./playground/data```.

We organize the data like the official code of [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). If necessary, you can refer to it.

## Training Script
1. **Visual detail injection module pre-training**:
Please use vdim-pretrain.sh, and all hyper parameters are in ```./vdim/configs/vdim_upsampler.yaml```. You can directly use our pretrained [VDIM module](https://huggingface.co/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2/clip-large-vdim.ckpt) of CLIP-ViT-L/14-336.
```bash
sh vdim-pretrain.sh
```
2. **model training**:
Please refer to train.sh for pretraining script and fine-tuning script (we comment in the file). 
If you want to do end-to-end pretraining, fine-tuning and evalutation, please run the following command.
You can directly use our pretrained [multimodal_projector](https://huggingface.co/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2/mm_projector.bin).

```bash
sh model-train.sh
```

## Evaluation
**1. Evaluation script**:
We use evaluation scripts to evaluate **MME, AI2D, DocVQA, ChartVQA, TextVQA, GQA, SciQA-IMG**.
You can run evaluation scripts in eval.sh:
```bash
sh eval.sh dir_name_in_checkpoints_new
# e.g. sh eval.sh llava-uhd-144-7b
# llava-uhd-144-7b is the dir_name stored in the path of ./checkpoints_new
```
Details of data organization:
1. please refer to [here](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Evaluation.md) for help.  We provide the same script to complete the testing.
2. For DocVQA, ChartVQA, please download images from [ureader-instruction-1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Mizukiluke/ureader-instruction-1.0), and download the annotations from [LLaVA-UHD-v2-Evaluation](https://huggingface.co/datasets/YipengZhang/LLaVA-UHD-v2-Evaluation), which are also constructed from [ureader-instruction-1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Mizukiluke/ureader-instruction-1.0).

**2. VLMEvalKit**:
We use [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) to evaluete **OCR-Bench, MMMU-val, SEED-Image, MMB, RealWorldQA, HR-Bench**. We integrate VLMEvalKit into this repository for better reproducibility. You can follow the setup instruction of [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit), and evaluate our model with this scripts:
```bash
sh VLMEvalKit/eval.sh
```


## LLaVA-UHD v1
For using **LLaVA-UHD v1**, You can follow the original project instruction and code of **LLaVA-UHD v1** in branch `LLaVA-UHD-v1`, or just set the following hyper paramerters in training script to change training mode to **LLaVA-UHD v1**.

```bash
--mm_projector_type adapt_spatial_resampler_v1
--feature_mode uhd_v1
```
